## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you identify a valid security issue, please report it via Github using the security tab. For more instructions check [here](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/security-advisories/guidance-on-reporting-and-writing-information-about-vulnerabilities/privately-reporting-a-security-vulnerability#privately-reporting-a-security-vulnerability)
There is no bounty available at the moment, but your github account will be credited in the acknowledgements section in the app documentation.
