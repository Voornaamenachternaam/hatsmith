[Hatsmith](https://hatsmith-topaz.vercel.app) is a web app that provides secure local file encryption in the browser. It's fast, secure, and uses modern cryptographic algorithms with chunked AEAD stream encryption/decryption.

Hatsmith is a fork of [Hat.sh](https://github.com/sh-dv/hat.sh), created by sh-dv, and other contributors. Hatsmith will be a drop-in replacement for Hat.sh, with the same features and security guarantees, and will keep the same versioning scheme.

## Usage

![how-to-use-gif](https://i.imgur.com/NbAZOgP.gif)

<br>

## Features

### Security

- XChaCha20-Poly1305 - for symmetric encryption.
- Argon2id - for password-based key derivation.
- X25519 - for key exchange.

The libsodium library is used for all cryptographic algorithms.

### Privacy

- The app runs locally in your browser.
- No data is ever collected or sent to anyone.â€‹

### Functionality

- Secure multiple file encryption/decryption with passwords or keys.
- Secure random password generation.
- Asymmetric key pair generation.
- Authenticated key exchange.
- Password strength estimation.

<br>

## Offline Use

The app can be easily self hosted, please follow the [installation](https://hatsmith-topaz.vercel.app/about/#installation) instructions.

<br>

## Browser Compatibility

We officially support the last two versions of every major browser. Specifically, we test on the following

- **Chrome** on Windows, macOS, and Linux , Android
- **Firefox** on Windows, macOS, and Linux
- **Safari** on iOS and macOS
- **Edge** on Windows

Safari and Mobile browsers are limited to single 1GB files, due to lack of support with server-worker fetch api.
